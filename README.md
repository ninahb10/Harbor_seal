# Haul-out behavior of harbor seals (_Phoca vitulina_) along the Norwegian coast

## MSc Project by Nina Hille Bringsdal, 2020-2021

## A Short Description of the Project
The goal of this study is to model and investigate haul-out behavior of harbor seals at selected sites along the Norwegian coast (Skagerrak, Nordland and Finnmark) with respect to changes in environmental and temporal variables. This will enable a better understanding of harbor seal biology, expand on previous knowledge, and provide a broader knowledge base for interpretation of population survey designs.
