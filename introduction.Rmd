# Introduction


### A little bit about harbor seal ecology

Harbor seals are pretty small seals compared to other pinnipeds, and the most widely spread of the pinniped species. They are a highly mobile, though coastal species, and can be found along temperate and Arctic coasts, in the Northern Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean, and in certain lakes in the Ungava peninsula in Canada, where they live in fresh water. Here in Norway, we have colonies all along the coastline and into fjord systems, and an isolated and protected population at Prins Karls Forland on Svalbard. 

Harbor seals haul out on more or less sheltered locations, and you can see them on skerries and sandbanks that appear above water at low tide. They haul out on a regular basis, at near-shore sites, with marked annual and individual variations. They haul out for many reasons, including the obvious rest between foraging trips, molting, pupping, nursing, thermoregulation, perhaps social interaction, and predator avoidance. 

During the time of pupping and mating, in June and July, and molting from August to September, the harbor seals are very place-bound, usually to their natal place, and haul out for longer periods at a time.

From the second half of September until June, it is hunting and feeding that has the highest priority. They will seek out high resource hunting grounds, often far away from where they were born. 

Harbor seals are generalists and top predators, and they play an integral role in the regulation of food webs in coastal landscapes.

### Management and Conflicts

Harbor seals have been intensively hunted, mainly due to perceived competition by fishermen, but they have done a comeback in recent years. They come into conflict with fishermen when they get caught up in, for example bottom gillnets. Bycatch of this kind can also be a potential issue for maintaining viable seal populations. Animal welfare also comes to mind. The Coastal Reference Fleet (KRF) and IMR have made estimations of discards – meaning fishes, birds and mammals caught as “by-catch” and thrown over-board again by Norwegian coastal gillnet fisheries on vessels between 9 and 15 meters, divided into 9 coastal areas.

The table here is from the report and inside the wobbly red line it shows how many harbor seals were reported as bycatch by the KRF in 2018. Area 09 with 788 seals is the Skagerrak-area. 1414 in total.

Another human-seal conflict exists because harbor seals facilitate parasitic roundworms (“kveis”). They distribute eggs via feces, which are then picked up by demersal fish, and consequently deteriorate the quality of the fish destined for fresh fish markets.

It is important to have knowledge about the absolute abundance and trends in population size of species, for the best and most effective management. Legal requirements that concern species protection also concern management and legislation of species on a species specific and biologically appropriate scale (Cunningham et al. 2008).

The harbor seals in Norway are managed in accordance with a management plan that has been adopted by the Norwegian authorities. The purpose of this plan is to ensure a viable seal population, in the seal’s natural distribution areas along the coast. Within this framework, seals can be harvested as a renewable resource. IMR states that the population must be regulated on the basis of ecological and social considerations. The plan also states that the harbor seals should be managed via quota-regulated hunting, so that the population is stabilized at a level where around 7000 harbor seals can be counted during molting. 

The counting is carried out yearly, in sub-areas, and a nation-wide estimate is obtained every fifth year. The counting is usually done when the harbor seals are hauled out during molting close to where they were born, which is a common method used all over Europe. In Norway, seals are more and more counted by photographs taken by drones. 

These estimates every five years form the basis for quota recommendations.

According to the Institute of Marine Research it is estimated that the full population now consists of around 10,000 individuals, which is based on the minimum count estimate of around 7600 animals.

But can we be more accurate in this estimate of the total population? 

The work I will carry out will hopefully help provide better correction factors that can refine this total estimate. Which takes me over to my project goal.

### Project Goal

My main goal is to investigate haul-out behavior of harbor seals along the Norwegian coast. This can potentially lead to a better understanding of seal biology AND correct or elaborate on existing national population surveys.

The main research topics are the frequency and the duration of different behaviors ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, and how these behaviors are affected by:

* individual traits, such as size and sex, 
their geographic location along the coast (northern versus southern Norway),
* environmental variables, such as
 tides
  + wind
  + water temperature
  + air temperature
  + daylight

So, in more technical terms, I hope to be able to provide correction factors for estimating abundance from seal counts on haul-out spots, by investigating haul-out frequency as a function of tidal amplitude and the other covariates I mentioned before. 

I have lots of data made available to me, both from the Skagerrak-area, Nordland and Troms and Finnmark, stretching over several years – and active tags in Skagerrak are still providing data and will until the next molt in the coming fall. It will be interesting to look at the relative importance of tides and other environmental variables in geographical areas that have contrasting tidal amplitudes and weather patterns.

Checking this referense [@sorlie2020].

According to @bjorge2002b, this is true.

This reference is a book reference [@brown1983].

@rosing2020 says that some harbor seals dive deeper than 400 meters.

These guys are pretty cool [@thompson1996; @womble2013].

This one is a report [@bjorge2014].

This might not work, but let's try these two citations [@ramasco2008; @ramasco2015].

This is the reference I use for data exploration [@zuur2015].
